Desktop app for tracking ARAM Mayhem match history in League of Legends. Connects to the League Client (LCU) to automatically record matches and display stats.

## Features

- Automatic match detection via League Client API
- Supports the limited-time ARAM Mayhem Classic-ish game mode
- Match history with detailed game breakdowns
- Champion, augment, and friend stats with win rates
- Aggregate statistics from all players in your games
- Local SQLite database

## Tech Stack

Electron + React + TypeScript, built with electron-vite. Uses Tailwind CSS for styling, better-sqlite3 for local storage, and league-connect for LCU integration.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run rebuild   # rebuild native modules for Electron
npm run dev       # start in dev mode
```

These run on pull requests, again before a tagged release, and locally via
`preversion` — so `npm version` will not tag a tree that fails them:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run format    # rewrites in place; format:check only reports
```

## Build

```bash
npm run dist      # build Windows portable executable
```
